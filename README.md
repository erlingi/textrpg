# TEXTRPG

This is a project where I'll make a simple text RPG game.

This project is programmed from a beginners perspective and will contain flawed and simple code.


# TODO

Replace player and monster object with a inheritance based object where main object will be:
"Character" --> Player, Monster

Same for weapon and consumables:
"Item" --> Weapon, Consumable
